# Compiler-Design

A compiler translates the code written in one language to some other language without changing the meaning of the program. It is also expected that a compiler should make the target code efficient and optimized in terms of time and space. This repository contains System Programming and Compiler Design Lab Practicals which I have performed.

**List of Experiments:**<br/>
•	First and follow<br/>
•	ICG<br/>
•	Lexical analyzer<br/>
•	Operator precedence parser<br/>
•	Remove left recursion<br/>
•	3 address code<br/>
•	Code generation<br/>
•	Common subexpression elimination<br/>
•	LEX program for Calculator<br/>
•	LEX program to count no of characters, spaces, words, lines<br/>
•	LEX program to count and identify vowels and consonants<br/>
•	LEX program to count and identify tokens<br/>
•	LEX program to count and identify uppercase and lowercase letters<br/>

Technologies used: C, Java 8, Eclipse IDE, Lex
